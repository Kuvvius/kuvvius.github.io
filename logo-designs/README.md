# Logo Design Options for Jiawei Gu's Personal Website

## Design Philosophy
Based on your research focus on **unified multimodal intelligence** and the philosophy of **"think in modalities, not just with them"**, these logos reflect:
- The evolution from language to multimodal reasoning
- The fusion of different modalities (language & vision)
- Breaking boundaries and thinking beyond constraints
- Your website's elegant purple gradient color scheme (#667eea → #764ba2)
